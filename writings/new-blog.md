Wait wait waaiiit?

I though I had published a new webiste post just a couple of months ago?
Where did that post go? Why am I posting a new 'new website post?'
Is this a new webiste?

# Next.Js

I mentioned it in a post on my old website that after I started building my new website a thought concurred that I should've built it with Next.js. I ended up using a simple `create-react-app`, which was great, kind of..

It worked well and I though it looked good.
However it was not good enough and had some flaws, the blog list was not optimized enough and I made some minor error while doing it, so the dynamicly generated URLs for every post was not behaving correctly.

I also had to run a command every time I updated a blog post, which was not a really big problem.
But I had some issues with displaying photos in my posts so it got repetitive and annyoing to run the npm command every time I made a update to single post.

I knew that it would be easier to handle routes in Next.js.
