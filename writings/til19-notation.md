[Rough-notation](https://roughnotation.com/) is a small but very impressive javascript library that creates and animates annotations for your page.

I think this is super cool, and it opens up a lot of interesting ideas for your webiste to look very cool.

I'm quite intrigued at trying this, make sure to look at my new page in the future to see this package in use. ðŸ¤–
