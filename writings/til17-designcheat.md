I know this can be quite a controversial discussion, but 'copying' other designs can be quite useful.

From [this](https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886) article:

"Every web developer inevitably runs into situations where they need to make visual design decisions, whether they like it or not."

It can be hard to make a well-designed website, especially if you have not gotten any practice or experience in designing.

So in the medium article mentioned above, you have well-thought-out steps on how you can make a design yourself.
Even though the original design may be from someone else.
